# Prototype: .NET, Tilt + Paketo Buildpacks w/ Hot Reload

## Background

This prototype aims to demonstrate the user experience that can be expected once buildpacks are integrated with watchexec and tilt.

A few caveats:
* No code changes were made to the buildpacks themselves.
* This does not represent a finished product, simply an exploration into the possible outcomes of this work.

## Prerequisites

* [`pack`](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack) CLI installed locally
* `tilt`
* Kubernetes cluster

## Usage

* `tilt up`
* Make code changes
* Watch it go!
