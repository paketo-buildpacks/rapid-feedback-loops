needed dotnet and kp cli
did not work on kind
tried it on minikube, ran into this issue
- https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt/issues/3079
- didn't work either way so created a GKE cluster and used that
have to set up secret "registry-credentials" and modify default SA to use it

custom_build does a full deploy first, and then watches the deps for
future changes. When one of those deps is also specified in the live
update field, it does not do a full build again - it just syncs those
changes.
